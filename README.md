# An Electricity-Basic Index of Economic Disruption
An electricity-based index of economic disruption for the Philadelphia area (and nearby regions).

This model links electricity and weather data in the PECO load area (Philadelphia and suburban counties) in an attempt to measure economic disruption in response to COVID-19. I am attempting to update this twice a week, and am sharing the code if anyone wants to create similar measures. Documentation and discussion of analysis is provided in the PDF.

There are similar (and broader) efforts underway by other researchers (for example, see Steve Cicala's [recent Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/SteveCicala/status/1240273368110202880)). I will link to them when their work goes live.
